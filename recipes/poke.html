    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tuna poke has been a staple of my diet for years.It
        always tastes so fresh and is a perfect light meal.
        
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sashimi-grade ahi tuna</li>
        <li>1-2 ripe medium avocados</li>
        <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped scallion</li>
        <li>2 minced garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger root</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon siracha</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat your tuna steak dry with a paper towel.
             Then, place on a cutting board and using a
              very sharp and large knife, cut 1-inch 
              sections, going against the grain. When 
              you've finished cutting the entire steak 
              going against the grain, begin cutting the 
              long strips in the opposite direction so 
              that you have 1 inch "cubes." Before you 
              just start cutting away, have a diagram in 
              your head for where you'll want to make the 
              cuts so that you end up with nice 1-inch 
              "cubes" of tuna. </li>
        <li>Cut open your avocado(s). Remove the seed and
             then using a soup-size spoon, carefully spoon 
             out the avocado halves. Turn them pit side 
             down and with the knife, cut 1-inch wedges 
             going length-wise. Then, cut in the opposite 
             direction to make "cubes." Place the avocado 
             and tuna in a medium mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the 
            soy sauce, grated ginger, garlic, sesame oil, 
            scallion, and Sriracha. Do a quick taste-test 
            to make sure you're happy with the heat and 
            saltiness. Note: Poke shouldn't be too spicy. 
            Sriracha isn't a standard ingredient though 
            many recipes call for red chili flakes. I just 
            like the taste of Sriracha.</li>
        <li>Pour the soy-ginger sauce on top of the chopped
             tuna and avocado. Carefully toss so that it's 
             all coated in sauce. Cover and refrigerate for 
             20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from fridge and sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy! Throw on top of white rice, in 
            a wonton taco shell, or on a lettuce wrap. Or 
            just enjoy it on its own!</li>
    </ol>
